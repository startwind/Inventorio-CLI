## Installation

Download the latest version of our PHAR archive and give it afterwards rights to be executed. To run Forrest you need
PHP installed.

```shell
wget https://github.com/startwind/inventorio-command-line/releases/latest/download/inventorio.phar
chmod +x inventorio.phar
```

Most likely, you want to put the inventorio.phar into a directory on your PATH, so you can simply call inventorio from
any directory (global install), using for example:

```shell
sudo mv inventorio.phar /usr/local/bin/inventorio
```

## Initialization

```shell
inventorio init 
```

## How to run

```shell
inventorio collect 
```
